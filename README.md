# Research Paper Tracker Application

Abstract

🔍 The Research Tracker application is a comprehensive solution designed to meet the needs of researchers, including both students and faculty members. It provides a powerful set of tools for managing research papers, offering features such as adding, editing, and deleting papers. The intuitive dashboard allows users to navigate through different departments and access a categorized list of approved research papers, enhancing visibility and exploration within specific fields of interest. The system efficiently manages user profiles, facilitates uploading and submitting research papers, and tracks the approval status of submissions. Administrators play a vital role in reviewing and approving pending research papers, funding applications, and patent requests. MySQL is used as the underlying database management system, ensuring secure and reliable storage, while JSP serves as the server-side technology for dynamic content generation and seamless interaction with the database.
